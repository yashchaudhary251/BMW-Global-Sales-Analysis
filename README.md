# BMW-Global-Sales-Analysis

üìå Project Overview

This project explores BMW‚Äôs global sales dataset (2010‚Äì2024), containing 50,000 rows √ó 11 columns.
We perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends in regions, models, fuel types, prices, and engine sizes.
Finally, we build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict Sales_Classification (High / Low).

üìÇ Dataset Description

Columns:

Model ‚Üí BMW car model (e.g., 3 Series, i8, 7 Series, X1‚Ä¶)

Year ‚Üí Year of sale/manufacture (2010‚Äì2024)

Region ‚Üí Region of sale (Asia, Europe, North America, etc.)

Color ‚Üí Car color (Red, Silver, White, etc.)

Fuel_Type ‚Üí Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, Electric

Transmission ‚Üí Manual / Automatic

Engine_Size_L ‚Üí Engine size in liters

Mileage_KM ‚Üí Mileage in kilometers

Price_USD ‚Üí Price in U.S. dollars

Sales_Volume ‚Üí Units sold

Sales_Classification ‚Üí Categorized sales (High / Low)

Data health check:

No missing values ‚úÖ

No duplicates ‚úÖ

Balanced categories (Models, Regions, Fuel Types all evenly distributed) ‚úÖ

üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
üåç Sales by Region

Asia leads slightly (~42.9M units)

Europe & North America follow very closely (~42.4‚Äì42.5M)

Africa, Middle East, South America slightly lower (~41.5‚Äì42.3M)
‚û°Ô∏è BMW sales are evenly spread worldwide.

üìà Sales Trend (2010‚Äì2024)

Stable base of ~16.5‚Äì17.0M units annually.

2019 peak: ~17.2M units.

2020 dip: ~16.3M (likely pandemic impact).

2022 record high: ~17.9M.

2023 dip, followed by 2024 recovery to 17.5M.
‚û°Ô∏è Sales are resilient, showing recovery after global disruptions.

üîã Fuel Type Trends

Hybrid sales growing steadily (highest in 2022 & 2024).

Electric sales rising gradually (strong in 2018, 2023).

Petrol & Diesel remain flat, showing no real growth.
‚û°Ô∏è BMW is shifting towards Hybrid and Electric models globally.

üöó Model Performance

7 Series is the global best-seller (~23.8M units).

i8, X1, and 3 Series follow closely (~23.2‚Äì23.4M each).

Even the lowest (M3) sold >22M units.
‚û°Ô∏è BMW has a diverse portfolio; success is not dependent on one model.

üí∞ Price Insights

By Region: Very small variation (~$74.7k to $75.5k).

By Model: 7 Series and 3 Series highest (~$75.5k); lowest (X6) ~$74.4k.

By Engine Size: Weak correlation ‚Äî some mid-size engines (2.1L, 3.6L, 4.2L) average higher prices than larger ones.
‚û°Ô∏è Price is consistent across regions and models; not strongly driven by engine size.

ü§ñ Machine Learning
Goal

Predict Sales_Classification (High vs Low).

Approach

Features used: Model, Year, Region, Color, Fuel_Type, Transmission, Engine_Size_L, Mileage_KM, Price_USD, Sales_Volume.

Model: Decision Tree Classifier (max_depth=8).

Evaluation: Accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix.

Results

Accuracy: 100%

Classification Report: Precision, Recall, F1 = 1.0 for both High and Low.

Confusion Matrix: Perfect separation between High and Low.

Feature Importance

Sales_Volume = 1.0 (100%)

All other features = 0.0

‚û°Ô∏è This shows Sales_Classification is completely determined by Sales_Volume (a simple threshold rule).
The model achieved 100% accuracy because of this direct relationship (target leakage).

üìú Key Takeaways

BMW maintains globally balanced sales ‚Äî strong in all regions.

Hybrids and Electrics are growing, while Petrol and Diesel remain flat.

Pricing is remarkably consistent worldwide, not strongly affected by engine size.

ML results:

Perfect accuracy achieved, but only because the target (Sales_Classification) is derived from Sales_Volume.

If Sales_Volume is removed, a more realistic challenge would be predicting sales classification from factors like Model, Region, Price, and Fuel_Type.
